# baritoneStashStealingBot

too prove to ionar that I could.


set the account that will load pearls coords inside baritoneCommandSlave. The moving account will use StashMover bot to set coords of the boundary around the chests you plan to move and have that accounts bed set there INSIDE the boundary coords. When you enable stashMoverbot it will mine chest if theres no shulkers on the ground, it will try to pick those up first and it will pause once it gets full and will message the slave account which toggles the slave account to move to a desired spot bringing back the mover account. Then the mover account goes to a kill self spot and throw a pearl in the set direction, then will walk foward dying to fall dmg and then the stuff falls in a hopper. Rinse and repeat.


The only known issue is that if you like mine a chest of totems, then u dont die on ur fall. I was too lazy to code around that cuz it rarely happend. 

Make sure to have autowalk to direction mode, autototem off, and viewlock to the direction You want to pearl, also by default baritone has chests on a block list not to mine, this causes a forever search if not disabled.
