# baritoneStashStealingBot

too prove to ionar that I could.


set the account that will load pearls coords inside baritoneCommandSlave. The moving account will use StashMover bot to set coords of the boundary around the chests you plan to move and have that accounts bed set there INSIDE the boundary coords. When you enable stashMoverbot it will mine chest if theres no shulkers on the ground, it will try to pick those up first and it will pause once it gets full and will message the slave account which toggles the slave account to move to a desired spot bringing back the mover account. Then the mover account goes to a kill self spot and throw a pearl in the set direction, then will walk foward dying to fall dmg and then the stuff falls in a hopper. Rinse and repeat.
